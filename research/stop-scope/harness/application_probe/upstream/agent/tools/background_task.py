"""One poll for every kind of background work.

Two things run in the background and both take long enough that the model has to
be able to ask "how far has it got": a command launched with
``background_execute``, and an environment refresh started by
``refresh_environment_start`` or the nightly cron. They keep their state in
different places — a command's in the thread sandbox's own filesystem, a
refresh's on the environment record plus a live trace on its builder — so each
kind owns a provider that knows how to read it, and this tool routes by the
task id's prefix.

Both report the same fields: ``status``, ``started_at``/``finished_at``,
``output``, and where that output came from. A refresh adds ``steps``, because a
rebuild is minutes to an hour of setup script and a single pending status cannot
tell slow from wedged.
