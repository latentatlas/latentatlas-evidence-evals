"""Rebuilding an environment's snapshot from its scripts.

Two kinds of refresh, both on a throwaway builder sandbox that is stopped once
its capture lands:

- ``full``: boot from the base snapshot, run ``setup_script`` then
  ``update_script``, capture. Nightly per environment on a LangGraph cron, and on
  demand from an admin thread. This is the lineage reset — every update chains
  snapshot to snapshot, and the nightly rebuild from base keeps drift from
  accumulating.
- ``update``: boot from the environment's *current* snapshot, run only
  ``update_script`` (a ``git pull``, a dependency sync), capture. Triggered
  lazily: creating a sandbox for an environment whose snapshot is older than
  ``UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` enqueues one in the background, so the image
  converges and later creations skip the work.

Creating a sandbox from a stale snapshot *also* runs the update script in that
sandbox, before the first model call — see ``SandboxCreateConfig.run_update_script``.
The background capture alone is not enough: it never helps the run that
triggered it, and when runs are sparse every run is a triggering run, so the
first one after a quiet spell would work against a checkout as old as the last
nightly rebuild.

The outcome — status, kind, timestamps, a capped log — lands on the environment
record for the dashboard. A failed refresh of either kind leaves the previous
snapshot in place: runs keep booting from the last image that worked.
